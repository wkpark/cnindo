> We present here a program written for the IBM System 360/65 digital
> computer for the calculation of CNDO and INDO molecular orbitals.[‡](#note2)<a name="rnote1"></a>
> The program is capable of computing CNDO wavefunctions for openand
> closed-shell molecules containing the elements H to CI and INDO
> open- and closed-shell calculations for molecules containing H to F.
>
> The matrices in the program are large enough to allow molecules
> containing up to 35 atoms or 80 basis functions (whichever is smaller).
>
> One atomic orbital basis function is allowed for hydrogen (1s), four
> each to the elements Li through F (2s, 2px, 2py, 2pz), and nine each to
> the elements Na through Cl (3s, 3px, 3py, 3pz, 3dz2, 3dxz, 3dyz, 3dx2-y2, 3dxy).
